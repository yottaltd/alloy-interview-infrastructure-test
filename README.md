# Alloy Interview Test

Welcome and thanks for having accepted the invite to this assignment.

We have just received a request from the dev team to deploy an application they just developed to finally resolve the burning issue of whether there are more cat lovers or dog lovers at Causeway?

The dev team has provided us with the source code of the front-end web-app, worker and the Node.js web-app along with the architecture of the application. You are to deploy the application and test it based on the requirements received.

The architecture of the application is shown in the `architecure.png`. The application is made up of a front-end web app in Python which lets a user vote between two options, a Redis cache which collects new votes, a .NET worker which consumes votes and stores them in the Postgres database backed by a storage volume and a Node.js web app which shows the results of the voting in real time.

We have been instructed that the database must use the `postgres:15-alpine` image, have the following credentials passed through environment variables `POSTGRES_USER: postgres`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres` and store the data at in `/var/lib/postgresql/data`. The cache must use `redis:alpine` image and have a storage attached to it to store the votes in `/data`.

Along with this we also need a debug deployment based off of `alpine:latest`. Through debug deployment we should be able to run:

* Network diagnostic commands, e.g. ping, tracert, etc.
* Redis querying through the `redis-cli` tool
* Postgres querying through the `psql` tool

### MUST TO HAVE ###
* The Python web-app is running, has readiness/liveness probes configured and is reachable from the outside
* The Node.js web-app is running, has readiness/liveness probes configured and is reachable from the outside
* The .Net worker is running
* The Redis cache is running, has readiness/liveness probes configured and is reachable from the outside
* The PostgreSql cache is running, has readiness/liveness probes configured and is reachable from the outside
* Ability to debug network, redis and db issues in the application

### NICE TO HAVE ###
* For security the databse should only accept Ingress from the cache and Egress should be blocked
* The client should be able to handle a spike in traffic on demand
